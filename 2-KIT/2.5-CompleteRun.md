##  Precautions
After the program runs normally, do not move the wooden blocks in the depalletizing area. The stacking order in the palletizing area depends on the stacking order of the wooden blocks in the depalletizing area, because the QR code ID numbers on the 18 wooden blocks are unique. IDs range from 1-18. The palletizing robot arm will stack the wood blocks in groups of 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12, 13-15, 16-18. The robotic arm needs to return to zero after each shutdown and restart.
