The size of the kit is approximately 120cm*60cm, and is designed with reference to the standard desk size. It can be used in multiple application scenarios such as education and teaching, commercial display, and industrial scene exploration and research and development. -->
&emsp;&emsp;UltraArm Sorting Kit Suite is a comprehensive suite that fully supports robot vision and robot application learning. It includes Ultron P340 series robotic arms, end effectors, cameras, scene kits and other components, and provides unique case practice and learning experience through open source Python programs. This kit is designed to simulate real robotic depalletizing and palletizing scenarios, supporting automated loading and unloading operations. When using this kit, users can develop application skills in multiple directions, including but not limited to machine vision, robot control, sensor control, scene fusion, and collaborative work of multiple robots.

&emsp;&emsp;The size of the kit is about 120cm*60cm, which is designed with reference to the size of a standard desk, so it is very suitable for exploration and research and development in education and teaching, commercial display, and industrial scenarios.

**Features of this kit include:**

- **Comprehensive**: Covers all aspects of robot vision and robot application learning, providing users with a full range of learning and practical experience.
- **Open Source Python Program**: Provides open source Python programs, allowing users to flexibly customize and expand the functionality of the suite, while also facilitating learners' learning and practice.
- **Simulate real scenes**: Designed to simulate real depalletizing and palletizing scenes, users can learn and practice relevant skills in the simulation environment, laying a good foundation for practical applications.
- **Multiple Application Scenarios**: In addition to education and teaching, it can also be used for commercial display and industrial scene exploration and research and development, with high flexibility and adaptability.


<!-- Using this scenario kit, you can learn multiple robot-related knowledge sections including machine vision, robot control, hand-eye calibration, conveyor belt control, robot palletizing, robot depalletizing, Python, robot suction pump control, etc. -->
