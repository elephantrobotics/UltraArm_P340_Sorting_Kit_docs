# Software Issues

**Q: When running the function display program, does the program report an error?**
- A: You need to first check whether the device's serial port number and camera number are correct, and whether the device's serial port number is occupied. Then use myblocky to return the robotic arm to zero, and then disconnect the device's serial port connection. Otherwise, an error message indicating that the serial port is occupied will occur. Also, please note that a USB docking station can only be connected to one USB camera, otherwise it will cause data conflicts and cause program errors.
  
**Q: When running the function demonstration program for the first time, the robot arm cannot grab the wooden block?**
- A: It is necessary to check whether the hand-eye calibration parameters are correct and whether the robot arm has been returned to zero first after powering off.

**Q: When running the function display program, the program suddenly reports an error and the device stops running?**
- A: You need to check whether the serial port cable of the device is loose.
